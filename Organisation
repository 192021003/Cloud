Businesses are striving to remain competitive and meet rising customer expectations while pivoting to address new challenges, including worker shortages, supply chain interruptions, and increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. As companies implement solutions to address these needs, it can put unprecedented demands on a businessâ€™s IT infrastructure, which may not be equipped to support new use cases and workloads at scale.

The burden on IT infrastructure will only continue to grow, with increased reliance on AI-enabled capabilities with ever-increasing dataset sizes, the need for more robust security features, overall application complexity, and burgeoning data density.

To achieve higher performance and greater flexibility, organizations worldwide have migrated complex workloads to the cloud.

However, a cloud-first strategy can pose its own challenges. Cloud migrations often lead to unexpected cost overruns, causing enormous frustration and potentially thwarting the goals of the entire organization. In fact, optimizing cloud costs post-migration was cited as a top cloud-related challenge by 39 percent of survey respondents in a 2024 State of the Cloud report by Flexera, and 59 percent of respondents reported that cloud cost optimization was a priority.1
